-Design a DS to perform Insert,Search,Delete,get Random,All in O(1).
-Given two arrays of ints of size m and m+n in sorted order. merge it inplace
-Why O(k+n)? Why can’t it be O(n) only?
-Given a linked list reverse the even nodes in one pass and in O(1) space.
 So 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8 should be converted to 1->8->3->6->5->4->7->2.

-Given an array containing integers, modify the array such that the 5’s are at the end and the rest are at the beginning (maintaining the same order).
-Given an undirected graph, count the number of cycles with 3 nodes.

-Given an array convert it to another array such that the following condition holds:
a < b > c < d > e < f > g < h where the modified array is {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h} Input: 1,2,3,4,5,6 Output: 1,3,2,5,4,6


-Given an array of integers. This array denotes ‘our’ own ascending order of the elements. So if the array is {2,3,1,4}, by mathematics we can say that 2<3<1<4. Given another array, sort this new array in ‘our’ ascending order. Let’s say the new array is {1,2,4,3,5,4,9,2}, output will be {2,2,3,1,4,4,5,9}. Note that since 5 and 9 do not occur, they are sorted by actual ascending order at the end. 2. Integers are coming in a stream. A special integer (say -9999) denotes reset. Design a data structure such that when the special integer comes the previous elements are printed in a zigzag way and all the elements are deleted (reset). And then continues to accept other integers. What DS will you use?

      a. What happens when two numbers map to same key?
      b. how does chaining work?
      c. What to do when you have a bad hashing function, and only we can modify the structure of hashmap not hashing function?
      d. What do to when you your hashmap is filled completely (as in all the linked list are filled up to their capacity)
