-What do you know about memory management in Operating Systems? What is segmentation? What is paging?

 Memory Management : Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free.  It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.
  
  Segmentation: Segmentation is a memory management technique in which each job is divided into several segments of different sizes, one for each module that contains pieces that perform related functions. Each segment is actually a different logical address space of the program. When a process is to be executed, its corresponding segmentation are loaded into non-contiguous memory though every segment is loaded into a contiguous block of available memory. Segmentation memory management works very similar to paging but here segments are of variable-length where as in paging pages are of fixed size. A program segment contains the program's main function, utility functions, data structures, and so on. The operating system maintains a segment map table for every process and a list of free memory blocks along with segment numbers, their size and corresponding memory locations in main memory. For each segment, the table stores the starting address of the segment and the length of the segment. A reference to a memory location includes a value that identifies a segment and an offset.
  
  Paging : A computer can address more memory than the amount physically installed on the system. This extra memory is actually called virtual memory and it is a section of a hard that's set up to emulate the computer's RAM. Paging technique plays an important role in implementing virtual memory. Paging is a memory management technique in which process address space is broken into blocks of the same size called pages (size is power of 2, between 512 bytes and 8192 bytes). The size of the process is measured in the number of pages.
  

-Given a station with n platforms. So each platform has one line. But these n lines join into one, after leaving the platform (on both sides). Each train has to wait a minimum of x minutes in the platform. Trains arrive from both ends. If all the platforms are occupied they wait. There is also a point beyond the end of the platform (on both sides). This point indicates that an incoming train has to wait at that point until a leaving train (from that end) passes that point. Design the whole system.

-How are big files stored in memory? What are the uses of B-tree? How is it more useful than BST?

-Given one billion file indexes and said that n files are missing. How would you identify the file indexes of those who are missing?

-Asked about internet. What happens when you type a URL on your browser?

-Design MP3 player which would play only unique songs in random order from given list of songs

-Design multiple stacks in a Single one big int array as efficient as possible ( real world example multiple process function stacks creation and deletion in memory of linux os )

-How would you combine lots of big sorted files residing on disk ( file size >>> memory )

-Design in-memory file system.

-Given millions of files process them sequentially in multiple stages and make sure it has good scalabilty, error handling, elegantly handles changes to the system. etc.

-Given a continuous stream of strings, maintain strings such that duplicate are eliminated on the fly. The interviewer wanted working code. So coded the solution during the interview and emailed it to him 10 mins after.
 So if you get “Ted”, “John”, “Mark”, “Ted”, “David”, at the moment in
 time, the list should contain John, Mark, David.

-Suppose we need a service to perform certain task every day at some specified time. How do we ensure that everyday at the specified time the service will do that task?


-Program to get the maximum distance between two nodes in the binary tree. The interviewer further generalized this problem for n-ary tree. Then he asked how to get the longest path in a graph.
-How does the garbage collector works in java?
-Design a restaurant reservation system. I was also asked to write some sql queries in this regard.
-Design a semaphore.
-A device need to upgrade and downgrade its software. Eg: mobile phone need to upgrade its OS. Design high level and low level.

-Explain inheritance and Base class is given you need to stop exposing the base class methods without touching the base class at all. It was really tricky.    question i liked it.

-What is deadlock and How to detect deadlock in system.
-Concept of Database normalization and various types of it.
-He also started asking some networking question. Like TCP/IP, socket connection.
-How the chat between 2 user work internally, internally how the packets flows between layer. And suppose user A send “Hi” message to user B and user B just shutdown the system. What will happen in that case.


- Given that you want to maintain a backend for a bookstore Application that would store names of Authors and books, such that the application can return all the books written by a specific Author and all the Authors of a specific book which is specified in a query. The query can be such that only a substring of the Authorname or the bookname is specified and all the matches should be returned. I proposed a trie based solution, and was asked to code the solution on a collabedit shared document.
- Describe multithreading.

-What is a singleton set What is the data storage model (Data structures) used to store records in a relational Database.
